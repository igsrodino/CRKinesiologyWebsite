        <h3>Kinesiology Counselling Consultation</h3>
        <h4>1 hr 30 min | $140</h4>
        <h4>2 hr | $170</h4>
        <p>Each “one on one” consultation is personal and different, depending on your needs. Using brain training, reprogramming and effective muscle testing techniques I will guide you in finding the outcome that you are looking for.</p>
        <p>When you have a kinesiology session, we first discuss what you want to change and achieve. Then, I use muscle bio-feedback as a tool, “muscle-testing”, to unlock the answers to any questions you may have about yourself. You will discover how your subconscious works and how it could either help or sabotage your great efforts and ideas and also stop you from having what you want.</p>
        <p>The best part is positively reprogramming those attitudes, so that you are able to make things in your life “happen.” </p>

        <h3>Couple's Consultation</h3>
        <h4>2 hrs | $240</h4>
        <p>In a couple’s consultation the approach is first to understand the points of view of each partner towards the issue that made the relationship face a challenge.</p>
        <p>It is not uncommon for couples to feel overwhelmed and overloaded trying to balance a healthy relationship in today’s busy life. Usually we forget who we are and why did we get into the relationship from the beginning.</p>
        <p>This therapy helps to unlock any communicative blocks and clear all the emotional attachments, meanings and tensions. We work on understanding and clear communication, care and respect, affection and physical intimacy developing positive changes to improve problem solving skills. </p>

        <h3>Facial Harmony Treatments</h3>
        <h4>1 hr | $120</h4>
        <h4>2 hr | $170</h4>
        <p>Facial Harmony is a gentle non-invasive treatment, designed specifically to work in sync with the nervous system, and gives an opportunity to experience peace and rejuvenation through sensitive touch. Working directly on the face and head, accesses many of the significant energy points relating to the various systems of the body, clearing stress levels and allowing rejuvenations and regeneration to take place.</p>
        <p>The face head and neck hold much of the body’s mental and emotional tension. During treatment you achieve a deep state of relaxation, through which, old mental and emotional negative patterns can be released. After a long time, the accumulation of stress will cause us to be less energetic and enthusiastic.</p>
        <p>When we apply Facial Harmony, your energy starts to flow again, making you feel reenergised and leaving you looking refreshed and younger.</p>
